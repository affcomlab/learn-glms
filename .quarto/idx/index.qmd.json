{"title":"Welcome","markdown":{"headingText":"Welcome","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis goal of this website is to create a set of open-source online modules to broaden the range of statistical models taught in graduate psychology programs beyond ANOVA and multiple regression. These modules provide a foundation for students to learn about the flexibility of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) across many common situations in applied research. We address the inherent issue facing the adoption of GLMs in psychology in that traditional teaching of GLMs does not stress the importance of selecting the approriate link functions. \n\n# About the Authors {.unnumbered}\n\n<b> Aaron Matthew Simmons </b> is a PhD student in the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science program at the University of Kansas and a core member of Dr. Jeffrey Girardâ€™s research lab. His research interests focus on Bayesian statistics, latent variable modeling, scale development, and how new modeling frameworks can be leveraged to study a wide range of cognitive and behavioral phenomena.  \n\n<b> Dr. Jeffrey Girard </b> is a recognized expert in quantitative methods and directs both the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science doctoral program at the University of Kansas and the Kansas Data Science Consortium (a state-wide collaboration of data science educators funded as part of a large NSF EPSCoR grant). He has extensive experience teaching graduate-level statistics at the University of Kansas and is one of the three co-founders (and primary instructors) of the Statistics, Methods, and Research Training (SMaRT) Workshops limited liability company, which teaches quantitative workshops to hundreds of trainee and professional researchers each year. Most relevant to this project are his expertise in generalized linear (mixed) modeling, frequentist and Bayesian estimation, the R programming language, the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system, the Git version control system, and the GitHub Pages web-hosting platform.\n\n# Funding {.unnumbered} \n\nThese materials were made possible by funding from the APS Fund for Teaching and Public Understanding of Psychological Science. You can read more about the fund [here] (https://www.psychologicalscience.org/members/teaching/fund)\n\n# This is a Quarto book.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit
