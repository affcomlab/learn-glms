These modules will act as a foundation for students to harness the flexibility of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) across many common situations in applied research. We contend that the inherent issue that plagues adoption of GLMs in psychology stems from traditional teaching of GLMs which has not stressed how the importance of the shape and nature of the outcome distributions affects the choice of link functions.\n\n\n\n",
